        I will upload the project to this website, and I will also make a gameplay video for those that don't want to install everything to get the game up and running</br>

		<p>I recorded my voice but it didn't record loud enough.  This game was made on Visual Studio 2015 with XNA Game Studio 4.0.4.  I've tried to setup my new PC to run the game, but it's more work than I want to spend on it, 
		so I uploaded a video that I started created in 2017.</p>  
		<p>This video shows off the first portion of the game.  This was my Capstone project that I did with 2 other students.
		We built this game from the ground up in 2 terms.  It was a lot of fun and I plan on designing more video games.</p>
